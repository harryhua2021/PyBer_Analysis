# Ride-Sharing Analysis
Produce analysis and visualization of ride-sharing data with Python.

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform a detailed analysis using ride-sharing data in order to investigate ridership and fare by city type. By creating a visualization of ride-sharing data for PyBer, this analysis can help improve access to ride-sharing services and gauge the affordability of fares in underserved neighborhoods.

# Results
Using analysis and aggregation of PyBers ride-sharing data, I created a statistical overview by leveraging the dataframe.

## By reviewing the summary, we can see that there are several key findings, including:
* Urban areas have the highest ridership while rural areas have the least.
* Urban areas have 4x more drivers when compared to suburban areas.
* Suburban areas have 6x more drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.
* Rural areas have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
* The summary data suggests a higher revenue relationship when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides in the city.

# Summary
Based on this analysis, my recommendation to the CEO to address any disparities among the city types is to increase the number of drivers in rural areas to ensure enough drivers to meet ridership demand. Rural area data show that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher when compared to those of suburban and urban areas. This analysis indicates that riders living in rural areas take longer trips. Therefore, the drivers operating on rural routes are also driving longer distances which are more time-consuming, which results in lower commuter frequency.
